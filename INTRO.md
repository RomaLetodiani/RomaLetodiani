Hey there! I'm Roman Letodiani, a Software Engineer who loves solving problems with code. I mostly work across Frontend and Backend development, focusing on building efficient and scalable apps. I’ve had the opportunity to work with various technologies and teams, and I'm currently transitioning into an AI Engineer. I’m also a huge GitHub enthusiast with a streak of over 540 days - coding is my passion! Check out my projects on Github ( https://github.com/RomaLetodiani ) and feel free to connect on LinkedIn ( https://www.linkedin.com/in/letodiani-roma/ ) 
Let’s build something awesome together!
