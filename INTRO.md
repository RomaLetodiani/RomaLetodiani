I mostly work across Frontend and Backend development, focusing on building efficient and scalable apps. I’ve had the opportunity to work with various technologies and teams, and I'm currently transitioning into an AI Engineer. I’m also a huge GitHub enthusiast with a streak of over 600 days - coding is my passion!
